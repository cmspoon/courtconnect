## Dataset

The dataset currently covers **NBA seasons from 2003–04 to 2023–24**, totaling over 12,000 player-season-team entries. It is stored in `nba_players.csv` and includes:
- Player 
- Team
- Season

## Known Challenges

- Players appearing on multiple teams in the same season
- Players who were on a roster but didn’t play due to injury
- Players with names containing accents or non-ASCII characters (e.g., Luka Dončić) may not import correctly

These are being addressed as the dataset is cleaned.

## Future Implementations

- Further Tests - Extend tests for allConnections feature
- Dataset Expansion - Extend dataset coverage to include seasons prior to 2003–04.
- Weighted Connections - Prioritize more meaningful connections by weighting superstar status, longevity, and team relevance.
- GUI Makeover - Transition to a more polished display
